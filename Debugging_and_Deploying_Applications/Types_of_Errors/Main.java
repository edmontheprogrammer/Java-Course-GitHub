         * Types of Errors in Java
         * 1. Compile Time Errors:
         * Compile time Errors or syntax errors that prevent us from compiling our
         * applications, these errors happen when we don't follow the grammar or
         * syntax of Java language, that's why we call them syntax errors, the other
         * errors don't happen at compile time, they happen at run time, when we run
         * our applicaitons. These compile time errors are easy to find and fix.
         * Our code editors like IntelliJ and VS Code tell us about the error.
         * But when you encouter an error that doesn't really, make sense, your best
         * source is Google and stackoverflow website.
         * 2. Runtime Errors:
         * Runtime errors are errors that happen at run time, when we run our
         * applicaitons. Run time errors are little tricky, to find run time errors we
         * need to use a tool called Debugger. So we want to run our application using
         * this debugger, and with this we'll execute our code line by line and look at
         * the value of various variables, and this will help us identify the source
         * of the problem.
