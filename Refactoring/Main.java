         * Refactoring:
         * Refactoring means changing the structure
         * of our code without changing its behavior
         * 1. Methods; methods should be between 5 to 10 lines
         * of codes and no more than 20. If you have a method that's
         * longer than 20 lines of codes, consider refactoring it.
         * 2. You refactor a method and make it shorter by taking some
         * of the codes and moving them into other methods
         * or create in new methods to host them.
         * 3. Whenever you refactor a method consider two things:
         * A. What are the concepts or lines of code that always go together
         * B. Repetitive patterns in the code, try to remove the reptitive code
         * 4.
